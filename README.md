# Miautastic

Devtober attempt used as an opportunity for learning Zenject framework. It's mini arcade game where you pick up dead mice by left mouse button. Make sure there are not too many of them on board. You can also click on cats to move them away. 

Esthetics inspired by Rau's video clip for 'Mistrz Sztuki' and dieback of 【﻿Ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ】
